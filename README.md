# Learn Hub
## Description:
Learn Hub is a university-based initiative designed to enhance and modernize the peer 
tutoring experience. The project aims to connect students who are capable of offering 
academic support with those who need assistance in specific courses, creating a 
structured and accessible system for learning. Instead of relying on informal or 
unstructured methods, the platform provides a unified space where learners can easily 
find support, explore tutor profiles, and select sessions that match their academic needs 
and schedules. Students benefit from features such as searching by course, asking 
questions, rating tutors, and using the favorites feature to save preferred tutors and 
courses for easy access in future sessions. Meanwhile, tutors can share resources, 
organize sessions, and interact with students more effectively. Administrators play a key 
role in maintaining quality by approving tutors, managing course offerings, and 
overseeing activity across the system. By centralizing these interactions, Learn 
Hub ensures a smoother, more reliable tutoring process that saves time and promotes 
academic success within the university community.
